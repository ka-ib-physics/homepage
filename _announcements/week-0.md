# Week 1 Announcement – Welcome to IBDP Physics! 🎉

Welcome to **IBDP Physics**!

I’m excited to start this journey with you. Over the upcoming period, we’ll explore how the universe works, from the motion of everyday objects to the behavior of atoms and galaxies.

To help you stay organized, we’ll be using our course **website** as the main hub for everything. Please take a few minutes this week to explore it. Here’s how it’s structured:

---

## 🔔 Announcements

- This is where you’ll find **weekly updates**, reminders, and any changes to the schedule.
- Check this section **at least once per week** (ideally more often).
- Important information about tests, deadlines, and special activities will always be posted here.

---

## 📚 Assignments

- All **homework, lab reports, and projects** will be listed in the **Assignments** section.
- Each assignment will include:
  - A **description** of the task  
  - The **due date**  
  - Any **files or resources** you need  
- Make it a habit to check upcoming assignments and plan your time.

## 🗓 Calendar

- The **Calendar** shows:
  - Lesson topics for each day  
  - **Deadlines** for assignments and lab reports  
  - **Quizzes, tests, and exams**  
- Use this to stay ahead and avoid last-minute surprises.
- You can use the calendar to help schedule your own study time each week.

- After each lesson, the **Lecture** (or **Lesson Materials**) section will include:
  - Slides or notes from class
